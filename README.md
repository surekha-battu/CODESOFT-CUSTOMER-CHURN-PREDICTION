## Objective
Can you develop a model of machine learning that can predict customers who will leave the company?

The aim is to estimate whether a bank's customers leave the bank or not. The event that defines the customer abandonment is the closing of the customer's bank account.

## Details about the dataset:
It consists of 10000 observations and 12 variables. Independent variables contain information about customers. Dependent variable refers to customer abandonment status.

## Result;
The model created as a result of LightGBM hyperparameter optimization became the model with the maxium Accuracy Score. (0.9116)
